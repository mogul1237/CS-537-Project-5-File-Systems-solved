Overview
There is only one part to this project:

File System Integrity: to be done in the xv6 hacking environment. Before beginning, we strongly recommend watching parts of videos from two previous discussion sections. The first video is relevant from minute 21:50 to the end; the second video is relevant from minute 32:00 to the end.
Notes
This project, like all others this semester, can be done with a single partner. Copying code (from other groups) is considered cheating. Read this for more info on what is OK and what is not!

Handing It In
The handin directory is ~cs537-1/handin/SECTION/login/p5/xv6 where login is your login and SECTION is your unofficial discussion section (e.g, 301).

Copy all of your source files (but not .o files, please, or binaries!) into the xv6/ subdirectory of your p5 directory. A simple way to do this is to copy everything into the destination directory directory, then type make to make sure it builds, and then type make clean to remove unneeded files.

Finally, into your p5 directory, please include a README file. In there, describe what you did a little bit. The most important bit, at the top, should be the authorship of the project, particularly if you had a partner. Include both partner’s names and CS logins to receive credit; please put the README in BOTH partners’ directories; put the code in just one. Do not put any code in the other person’s handin directory!
